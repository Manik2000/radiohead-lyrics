When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

But I'm a creep, I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

I don't care if it hurts
I wanna have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

You're so fuckin' special

As your bad day disappears

Come back in focus again

They've got a Cheshire cat grin
All blurring into one

Before the night owl
Before the animal noises
Closed circuit cameras
Before you're comatose

Before you run away from me
Before you're lost between the notes
The beat goes 'round and 'round
The beat goes 'round and 'round

I just pretended that I had
Words are blunt instruments
Words are sawn-off shotguns
Come on and let it out

Before you're lost between the notes

Regular exercise at the gym three days a week
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries
At ease
Eating well
No more microwave dinners and saturated fats
A patient, better driver
A safer car
Baby smiling in back seat
Sleeping well, no bad dreams
No paranoia
Careful to all animals
Never washing spiders down the plughole
Keep in contact with old friends
Enjoy a drink now and then
Will frequently check credit at moral bank
Hole in wall
Favors for favors
Fond, but not in love
Charity standing orders
On Sundays ring road supermarket
No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants
Car wash, also on Sundays
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate
Nothing so childish
At a better pace
Slower and more calculated
No chance of escape
Now self-employed
Concerned, but powerless
An empowered and informed member of society Pragmatism, not idealism
Will not cry in public
Less chance of illness
Tires that grip in the wet
Shot of baby strapped in back seat
A good memory
Still cries at a good film
Still kisses with saliva
No longer empty and frantic

The breath of the morning I keep forgetting
The smell of the warm summer air
I live in a town where you can't smell a thing
You watch your feet for cracks in the pavement
Up above aliens hover
Making home movies for the folks back home
Of all these weird creatures who lock up their spirits
Drill holes in themselves and live for their secrets

They're all uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight
Uptight, uptight

I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane
Late at night when I'm driving
Take me on board their beautiful ship
Show me the world as I'd love to see it
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life
They'd shut me away

Stirring up inside of me

Wish that I... was bulletproof

Wax me, mould me
Heat the pins and stab them in

Just wish that it

So, pay me money and take a shot
Lead, fill the hole in me

Shove it in your mouth

They would have drowned you at birth

But now

Feel so tongue tied

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up

Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

Destiny, destiny, protect me from the world

Here we are, with our running and confusion
And I don't see no confusion anywhere

And if the world does turn, and if London burns
I'll be standing on the beach with my guitar
I wanna be in a band when I get to heaven
Anyone can play guitar and they won't be a nothing anymore

Grow my hair
Grow my hair, I am Jim Morrison

Beauty will destroy your mind, spare the gory details
Give them gift-wrapped for the man with everything
Though I lived a lonely life, I was confused
A butcher, I feel nothing

Up, up, through my heart into my brain
Arm a bit slack,  a basic combination
Cut out of chopped liver on the block

Was always waiting for the crush
The car to drive right through the shops
To call in sick and late at work
And take a holiday

Was always tangled up in knots
To keep myself from speaking up
But no-one's listening anyway
They're just trying to bribe me

And if it's alright, then what am I doing here?
And if it's alright, this place is gassed by fear
And if it's alright, I'll tell you, 'cause you never understand
And if it's alright, I'll beg you, 'cause I'm a begging kind of man

Today I wrote a bad cheque
Packed a bag and took a jet
But no-one's looking anyway

I sat in the cupboard
And wrote it down in neat
They were cheering and waving, cheering and waving
Twitching and salivating like with myxomatosis
But it got edited, fucked up
Strangled, beaten up
Used in a photo in Time magazine
Buried in a burning black hole in Devon

Transport, motorways and tramlines
Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Sentimental drivel, clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing

Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around

Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel

One day I am gonna grow wings
Chemical reactions
Hysterical and useless

Once again, I'm in trouble with my only friend
She is papering the windowpanes
She is putting on a smile
Living in a glass house

And once again, packed like frozen food and battery hens
Think of all the starving millions
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones
Your royal highnesses

Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat

Big Bird Story by Stanley Donwood,OK Computer OKNOTOK 1997 2017 CASSETTE,2017-07-21,"5 ContributorsBig Bird Story by Stanley Donwood Lyrics
Big Bird
Whilst on a walking holiday in remote regions
I chance upon a secluded valley
Away from the popular walking routes
Some distance along the valley
I come across a scene so breathtakingly beautiful
That I drop to my knees in wonder
There  is something about the serried ranks
Of deciduous and coniferous trees
Standing tall on the opposite bank
Of the river that sets my heart ablaze
The colours of the foliage are poetic
Whilst the arrangement of species seems divinely inspired
Clouds swoop and whirl above the topmost branches
And the river sparkles through an uncertain reflection below
Suddenly, the sky darkens, and along the river advances a flotilla of huge birds with menacing eyes
The size of the birds staggers me; one is as tall as a bus, and the others not much smaller
Their plumage is a shimmering blue
But their eyes are full of hate and looming disaster
With a horrible sinking feeling
I realise that the birds have noticed me
You might also likeOne of them clambers up the nearside bank
And waddles towards me
I take to my heels, and scramble along the path
Gaining speed, I run at full tilt
Then I see people in front of me, running towards me
First one passes, then another, then another
They are wide-eyed with terror, and keep taking quick
Fearful looks behind them
There must, I realise, be something unutterably horrible in front of me, but my fear of the big birds compels me to carry on
More people run past me, all with the same frightened expression. They are running towards the birds, away from something unknown
I am running from the birds, towards something unknown. Not for the first time in my life, I curse my bad luckEmbed"

Mow us down again

The action into the chain
An action with some meaning
A brief release of hope

The Moonies are up on the mountain
The lunatics have taken over the asylum
Waiting on the rapture
Singing, ""We're here
To keep your prices down
Feed you to the hounds
To the Daily Mail”
Together, together

You made a pig's ear
You made a rude mistake
Paid off security
And got through the gate
You got away with it
But we lie in wait
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey
Hey hey, hey hey hey hey hey

Where's the truth? What's the use?
In hanging 'round, lost and found
With your head in the sand
Fat chance, no plan
No regard for human life
Keep trying, you’ve no right
Fast and loose, win or lose
Jumped the queue, go back again
President for life
Lord of all the flies in the sky
The beasts of the earth, the fish in the sea

I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here

Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down
And nail my feet up where my head should be
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm
You have this expression dear no words could take its place
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face

I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls
If you'll wear it proudly through the snakepits and catcalls
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss
If you don't know what is wrong with me
Then you don't know what you've missed
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess
And a handful of eagerness says ""What do you suggest?""

Oh Lord please won't you tell me
Why must I be the thief?

Why must I be the thief
He said to the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
That's better off, and always stares

Why must I be the thief?
He asked of the hanging man
And how come you're the only one
Who gives me an open hand
Why must I be the thief?
He cursed and then he cried
And the hanging man held out his hand
And looked beyond the sky

The thief that climbed the cross
""We should have shared that other's fate.""
But the Jesus man said ""Not now""
""My brother, not now, it's far too late!""

Starting and then stopping
Taking off and landing
The emptiest of feelings
Disappointed people
Clinging on to bottles
And when it comes it's so, so disappointing
Let down and hanging around
Crushed like a bug in the ground
Let down and hanging around
Shell smashed, juices flowing
Wings twitch, legs are going
Don't get sentimental
It always ends up drivel
One day I am gonna grow wings
A chemical reaction
Hysterical and useless

Wait and see the fire

Be a world child, form a circle

A green plastic watering can
For a fake Chinese rubber plant
In a fake plastic earth
That she bought from a rubber man
In a town full of rubber plants
To get rid of itself

It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out
It wears her out

She lives with a broken man
A cracked polystyrene man
Who just crumbles and burns
He used to do surgery
For girls in the eighties
But gravity always wins

And it wears him out
It wears him out
It wears him out
It wears
She looks like the real thing
She tastes like the real thing
My fake plastic love
But I can't help the feeling
I could blow through the ceiling
If I just turn and run

And it wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out
It wears me out

And if I could be who you wanted

Exploding gracefully, burning up the freeway

Well, it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you
Oh baby, burn

Useless rockers from England
Good times had by all
Just swallow your guilt and your conscience

Interstate Five runs straight down the middle
